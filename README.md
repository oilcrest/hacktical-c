# Hacktical C
A practical hacker's guide to the C programming language.

*In memory of [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie),
one of the greatest hackers this world has known.*

## About the book
This book assumes basic programming knowledge. We're not going to spend a lot of time and space on explaining features that don't behave differently in important ways compared to other mainstream languages. Instead we're going to focus on practical techniques for making the most out of the power and flexibility C offers.

Keep in mind it's very much a work in progress, mind the gaps, and please report any issues you come across or suggestions for improvements in the repo.

## About the author
Programmers tend to fall in to categories, with very different motivations. I've always identified as a hacker. I like solving tricky problems, tend to interpret rules as challenges, and prefer using powerful tools that don't get in my way. To me, software is all about making a positive change in the real world.

I've been writing code for fun on a mostly daily basis since I got a Commodore 64 for Christmas in 1985, professionally in different roles/companies since 1998.

I started out with Basic on the Commodore, went on to learn Assembler on an Amiga, Pascal on PC; C++, Modula-3, Prolog, Ruby, Python, Perl, JavaScript, Common Lisp, Java, Erlang, Forth, Haskell, SmallTalk, Clojure, Go, C#, Swift, Kotlin.

For a long time, I didn't pay much attention to C; the language felt primitive, especially compared to C++. But gradually over time, I realized that the worst enemy in software is complexity, and started taking C more seriously.

Since then I've written plenty of C; and along the way I've picked up a number of techniques that helped me make the most out of the language and appreciate it for its strengths.

This book is an attempt to synthesize that experience.

## Why C?
The reason I believe C is and always will be important is that it stands in a class of its own as a mostly portable assembler, offering similar levels of freedom.

C doesn't try very hard to prevent you from making mistakes. It has few opinions about your code and happily assumes that you know exactly what you're doing. Freedom with responsibility.

These days; many programmers would recommend choosing a stricter language, regardless of the problem being solved. Most of those programmers wouldn't trust themselves with the kind of freedom C offers, and many haven't bothered to learn the language properly.

Since the foundation of the digital revolution, including the Internet was built using C; it gets the blame for many problems that are more due to our immaturity in designing and building complicated software than about programming languages.

The truth is that any reasonably complicated software system created by humans will have bugs, regardless of what technology was used to create it. Using a stricter language helps with reducing some classes of bugs, at the cost of reduced flexibility and increased effort in expressing a solution.

Programmers like to say that you should pick 'the right tool for the job'; what many fail to grasp is that the only people who have the capability to decide which tools are right, are the people writing the code. Much effort has been wasted on arguing and bullying programmers into picking tools other people prefer.

## Building
The makefile requires `gcc`, `ccache` and `valgrind` to do its thing.

```
git clone https://github.com/codr7/hacktical-c.git
cd hacktical-c
mkdir build
make
```

## Platforms
Since Unix is all about C, and Linux is currently the best supported Unix out there; that's the platform I would recommend. There's also Free/Open/NetBSD, which have less support but are equally enjoyable from my experience.

All of the above support [valgrind](https://valgrind.org/), which makes coding C a lot safer and more productive.

Microsoft has unfortunately chosen to neglect C for a long time, its compilers dragging far behind the rest of the pack. Windows does however offer a way of running Linux in the form of WSL2, which works very well from my experience.

macOS keeps diverging from its Unix roots, which makes coding C in that environment increasingly frustrating.

## Portability
The code in this book uses several GNU extensions that are not yet in the C standard; cleanup attributes, multi-line expressions and nested functions specifically.

Except for nested functions, extensions used in the code should work just as well in `clang`.

I can think of one feature, `hc_defer()`, which would currently be absolutely impossible without extensions.

## Chapters
The content is arranged to form a natural progression, where later chapters build on concepts that have already been introduced. That being said; feel free to skip around, just be prepared to backtrack to fill in blanks.
